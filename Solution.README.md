# Welcome to the Todo List 

## Goal

### Statement

>**_We aim to create a platform that empowers team members to collaborate and perform at their best while balancing speed and quality to deliver value to our clients._**

### Approach

This implementation provides an overview of the engineering practices, principles, tools, and utilities employed by software and quality assurance engineers. Many of these elements are crucial for designing, developing, and testing applications that are maintainable, scalable, secure and ready for production.

### In practice

Although the implementation is a simplified version of a real-world application, it provides a glimpse into the practices and principles essential for building and operating a production-ready application. 

We may use some or all of the elements for a real-world project depending on the application's complexity, requirements, and constraints.

### Why is this important

Having a local development environment that closely resembles the production environment enhances our development process and improves the quality of our final product.

Here are some of the benefits:

#### Early Detection of Issues

By mirroring the production environment, we can identify and fix environment-specific issues early in the development cycle, reducing the likelihood of encountering critical problems later.

#### Consistency and Reliability

Consistent environments help ensure that code behaves the same way locally as it does in production. This consistency will reduce the number of environment-related bugs and discrepancies we encounter.

#### Improved Testing

A production-like local environment allows for more accurate and comprehensive testing, including performance and load testing, ensuring that our solution can handle real-world scenarios effectively.

#### Faster Feedback Loop

We can test changes and receive immediate feedback on our local machines, speeding up the development process and increasing productivity.

#### Reduced Deployment Risks

By validating changes in an environment that closely resembles production, we can be more confident that deployments will be smooth and error-free, reducing the risk of deployment failures.

#### Enhanced Debugging

Debugging issues locally in an environment similar to production makes it easier for us to reproduce and diagnose problems, leading to quicker resolution times.

#### Improved Developer Confidence

When tested and validated in an environment that closely resembles production, we have greater confidence in our code, leading to higher-quality software.

## Engineering practices and principles

### Agile

- **Frameworks** - Scrum, Kanban, Lean.
- **Principles** - Iterative development, flexibility, customer collaboration, and response to change.

### Application Architecture and Design Patterns 
- **Purpose** - Provide proven solutions to common design problems.

### Automated Testing
- **Types** - Unit tests, contract tests, end-to-end tests.
- **Benefits** - Detects bugs early, ensures new changes do not break existing functionality, and improves code reliability.

### Code Refactoring
- **Purpose** -  Improve code structure and readability without changing functionality.
- **Benefits** - Reduces technical debt, enhances maintainability, and improves performance.

### Code Reviews
- **Purpose** - Improve code quality, ensure adherence to coding standards, and facilitate knowledge sharing.

- **Process** - Peer review of code changes before they are merged into the main codebase

### Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
- **CI** - Automatically integrating and testing code changes frequently.

- **CD** - Automatically deploying code changes to dev, test, staging and production environments.

> Although we do not automatically deploy our code as part of this assessment, a local development environment that resembles other environments has been provided.

### Documentation
- **Types** - Code comments, API documentation, user manuals, architecture diagrams.
- **Benefits** - Facilitates understanding, maintenance, and onboarding of new developers.

### Version Control
- **Purpose** - Enables tracking changes, collaborating with team members, and managing different code versions.

## Back End

The following section reminds us of the considerations that need to be made when designing, building, and operating APIs.

### Security

#### Encryption 

SSL will be offloaded to a load balancer or gateway provided by the cloud provider. The client will then securely communicate over HTTPS while the load balancer or gateway forwards the traffic to the backend container over HTTP. 

#### Authentication and Authorisation

JWTs will be used to secure the Todo List Web API by providing a stateless, compact, and self-contained method for authenticating and authorising users, ensuring only valid tokens can access protected resources. 

JWTs embed user information and permissions within the token, improving scalability, reducing server load, and enhancing security.

#### Scalability
We want to design an API that can handle increasing loads, consider the use of caching and load balancing, and ensure that it can run on scalable infrastructure.

#### Performance
Aim to optimise response times with efficient code, database indexing, and minimising payload sizes.

#### Reliability
Ensure high availability with redundant systems, failover mechanisms, retry mechanisms, and robust error handling.

#### Rate Limiting
Aim to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage by limiting the number of requests a client can make.

#### Monitoring
Implement logging and monitoring to track usage and detect issues.

#### Versioning
Consider using versioning to support changes without disrupting existing clients or ensure that changes are always backward compatible.

#### Compliance
Adhere to relevant legal and industry standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

### Health Checks

The Todo List API provides two health check endponts:

| Endpoint | Description
|----------| -----------
| `/health` | Startup health check|
| `/health/dependency` | Dependency health check that validates the state of the Redis Cache and SQL Server

### Application Architecture

We prefer the use of Clean Architecture and Domain Driver Design for our ASP.NET Web API, which organises our application into four main layers:

- Presentation - The API is the entry point for communication with the application.
- Application - Business logic specific to the use cases in our application.
- Domain - Entities, value objects and aggregates, and domain-specific services.
- Infrastructure - Implementation details and integration include repositories, database context and external service.

Benefits 

- Separation of concerns, with each layer having distinct responsibilities, making the code base easier to understand and maintain.
- Flexibility that allows us to make updates to the technology stack without affecting or retesting the core business logic.
- Improves testability as business logic can be tested independently from the UI and Infrastructure.

### Framworks and Libraries

We have selected the the following libraries for our implementation:

|Framework / Library|Description|
|-|-|
| [AutoMapper](https://github.com/AutoMapper/AutoMapper) | A convention-based object-object mapper. |
| [EF Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/) | Entity Framework (EF) Core is a lightweight, extensible, open source and cross-platform version of the popular Entity Framework data access technology. |
| [Fluent Validation](https://github.com/FluentValidation/FluentValidation) | FluentValidation is a .NET library for building strongly-typed validation rules. |
| [MediatR](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR) | Simple mediator implementation in .NET. In-process messaging with no dependencies. |

### Contract first development

We use a contract-first approach when designing and developing the Todo List API. 

In collaboration with other members of the team, we ensure:

- A documented representation of what we will be building. 
- Allow for early validation that helps identify design issues.
- Contain the endpoints, methods, request and response formats, and expected error codes.
- Ensure we reduce inconsistencies between what we have documented and what we are implementing.
- Engineers in the same or different teams can work in parallel once the contract is defined.
- The front-end and quality assurance engineers can start development against mock servers.
- It provides safety when refactoring, knowing that internal changes do not affect the API interface.
- Improves visibility and the opportunity to identify breaking changes as part of the Pull Request process.
- Generate code for controllers and clients 

### Contract Tests

Contract testing ensures that interactions between the front end and back end adhere to our predefined contract, reducing the risks of integration issues. 

During development, it allows the team to detect breaking changes early in the development cycle, improving reliability and increasing the overall stability of our solution.
